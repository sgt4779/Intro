Thank you for stopping by. An update on me and what this repository holds. I am a Network Engineer specializing in cyber security and digital forensics. I wanted a place to share my content and to collaborate with other like-minded Jedi to improve on my ability and hopefully help in any way I can in their abilities. I love penetration testing and red team activities. I love and work with the art of physical pentest, network, internal, external, and cloud. This repository has old projects from other contracts and you will see one repository for scripts and tools I am using for engagements, and you will see another Repository for Obsidian and Notes and templates there. The last place is the Reports. Here I am making all the Engagements that I do into Reports. I want that to be second nature. Have a look and see if anything here can help you in your journey of being a master Jedi.
