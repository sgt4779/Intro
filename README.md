Thank you for stopping by. An update on me and what this repository holds. I am a Network Engineer specializing in cyber security and digital forensics. I wanted a place to share my content and collaborate with other like-minded cyber professionals. My biggest passion in cyber security is penetration testing. The types of pentest I have worked with are Network, Internal, External, Web, API, Mobile, and Cloud. This repository will hold reports from when I started doing (CPT) controlled penetration testing (my younger days). This Reposityro will also hold CTF that I have been doing. I also have a new folder for this year called (2023Reports). Over the last 3 years I have evolved with tools and methodology and (2023Report) will show some of those evolutions. Gratitude again for stopping by.

PS. White hat or no hat
